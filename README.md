# Numpy-Practice

NumPy (or Numpy) is a Linear Algebra Library for Python, the reason it is so important for Data Science with Python is that almost all of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main building blocks. Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries. Numpy has many built-in functions and capabilities such as vectors, arrays, matrices, and number generation. I attached my solutions to NumPy practice questions to this repository, and below is an example:
